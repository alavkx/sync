# Kalphite Project Goals

## Overview

The Kalphite project is a **memory-first, schema-agnostic sync engine** designed to simplify async state management in modern web applications. The project consists of two main components:

1. **@kalphite/sync** - The core sync engine library
2. **code-review-app** - A demonstration application showcasing the engine's capabilities

## Primary Goals

### ðŸš€ Eliminate Async Complexity in UI Code
- **Goal**: Make async operations feel synchronous to developers
- **Value**: No more loading states, no more async/await complexity in UI code
- **Approach**: Keep all data in memory for instant, synchronous access

### ðŸ“‹ Schema-Agnostic Architecture  
- **Goal**: Work with any Standard Schema compliant library (Zod, Valibot, ArkType, Effect Schema)
- **Value**: Developers can use their preferred validation library
- **Approach**: Built on Standard Schema specification for maximum compatibility

### âš¡ Optimistic Updates with Background Sync
- **Goal**: Provide instant UI feedback while handling sync transparently
- **Value**: Improved user experience with responsive interfaces
- **Approach**: UI updates immediately, sync happens in background

### ðŸŽ¯ Type-Safe Development Experience
- **Goal**: Full TypeScript inference from schema definitions
- **Value**: Catch errors at compile time, improved developer experience
- **Approach**: Leverage TypeScript's type system with schema integration

## Technical Objectives

### Core Sync Engine (@kalphite/sync)

#### Layer 1: In-Memory Store âœ… (Complete)
- Synchronous data access through memory-resident collections
- Type-scoped operations (`store.comment.upsert()`, `store.review.delete()`)
- Array-like access patterns with full method support
- React integration with automatic re-rendering
- Performance target: Handle 10k+ entities smoothly

#### Layer 2: Memory Flush Engine ðŸš§ (In Progress)
- Automatic background persistence with debounced writes
- Error recovery for failed operations
- Minimize I/O operations while ensuring data durability

#### Layer 3: Frontend Database ðŸ“‹ (Planned)
- PGlite integration for in-browser SQL database
- Automatic schema migration capabilities
- Offline-first data persistence

#### Layer 4: Network Sync ðŸ“‹ (Future)
- Real-time collaboration features
- WebSocket-based updates
- Conflict resolution algorithms

### Demo Application (code-review-app)

#### Functional Goals
- **Real-time code review tool** demonstrating practical Kalphite usage
- **Git integration** for viewing diffs between commits
- **Inline commenting** with line-specific feedback
- **Review workflow** with approval/rejection status
- **Type-safe operations** throughout the application stack

#### Technical Demonstration Goals
- Show **schema-first design** patterns with Zod integration
- Demonstrate **service layer pattern** for business logic organization
- Illustrate **React hook patterns** with automatic re-rendering
- Prove **end-to-end type safety** from schema to UI
- Showcase **optimistic updates** in real user interactions

## Success Criteria

### Developer Experience
- **API Intuitiveness**: `store.comment` instead of `store.getByType("comment")`
- **Zero Async UI Code**: No loading states required for data access
- **Type Safety**: Full inference without manual type annotations
- **Schema Flexibility**: Support for multiple validation libraries

### Performance Targets
- **Memory Efficiency**: Handle 10k+ entities without performance degradation
- **Instant Updates**: UI responds immediately to state changes
- **Background Sync**: Network operations don't block user interactions

### Demonstration Success
- **Complete Code Review Workflow**: End-to-end reviewing experience
- **Real-world Patterns**: Service layers, React hooks, business logic
- **Learning Resource**: Clear examples for new Kalphite developers

## Architecture Philosophy

### Memory-First Design
- All data lives in memory for synchronous access
- Background persistence handles durability
- Network sync maintains consistency across clients

### Schema-Driven Development
- Entity definitions drive type inference
- Standard Schema compliance ensures library flexibility
- Runtime validation with compile-time safety

### Optimistic-First Operations
- UI updates happen immediately
- Background sync resolves eventual consistency
- Error handling doesn't block user experience

## Out of Scope (Current Phase)

### MVP Limitations
- CI/CD integration features
- Multi-user concurrent editing
- PR synchronization with GitHub/GitLab
- AST-aware diff analysis
- Comment threading systems
- Advanced WebSocket features

### Future Considerations
- Enterprise security features
- Advanced conflict resolution
- Plugin architecture
- Performance monitoring
- Distributed sync capabilities

## Technology Stack

### Core Engine
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Schema**: Standard Schema specification support
- **Storage**: In-memory with planned PGlite integration
- **Validation**: Zod (primary), Valibot, ArkType, Effect Schema

### Demo Application
- **Frontend**: React 19, TanStack Start, TanStack Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Build**: Vite, Vinxi
- **Git Integration**: simple-git library
- **Testing**: Vitest, Testing Library

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% coverage for core engine
- **Performance**: <50ms response time for 10k entity operations
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for typical application state
- **Bundle Size**: <50KB minified for core library

### Developer Experience Metrics
- **API Simplicity**: Reduce boilerplate by >80% vs traditional async patterns
- **Type Safety**: Zero runtime type errors in well-typed code
- **Learning Curve**: New developers productive within 1 day

### Demo Application Metrics
- **Feature Completeness**: Full code review workflow
- **User Experience**: Responsive UI with <100ms perceived latency
- **Code Quality**: Demonstrates best practices and patterns

This project aims to fundamentally simplify how developers work with async state management while maintaining the flexibility and type safety modern applications require.
