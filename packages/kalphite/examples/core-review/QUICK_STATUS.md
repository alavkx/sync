# üö® Quick Status: Core Review Demo

## Current Issue

**Network sync is NOT working** - when you create reviews, no network requests are sent.

## What Works ‚úÖ

- Local memory store (fast operations)
- localStorage persistence (data survives refreshes)
- React UI (responsive, no blocking)
- Export/clear data controls

## What's Broken ‚ùå

- **No network requests** when creating/editing reviews
- **No multi-client sync** between browser tabs
- **Sync engine exists but not connected** to store operations

## Root Cause

The `OperationSyncEngine` is implemented but not wired to `KalphiteStore` operations. When you do:

```typescript
reviewStore.review.push(newReview); // ‚úÖ Works locally
```

It should also trigger:

```typescript
syncEngine.executeOperation("createReview", [...])  // ‚ùå Never happens
```

## Next Steps

1. **Wire sync engine to store** - integrate OperationSyncEngine with KalphiteStore
2. **Map operations** - connect entity mutations to named sync operations
3. **Test network requests** - verify POST calls to `/api/operations`
4. **Create backend server** - implement sync endpoints

## Files to Fix

- `packages/kalphite/examples/core-review/store.ts` - Add sync engine integration
- `packages/kalphite/src/store/KalphiteStore.ts` - Connect flush engine to sync engine
- Create backend server on `localhost:3001`

_The persistence foundation is solid, we just need to complete the network bridge._
