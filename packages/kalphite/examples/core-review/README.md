## Data Model

### Review Entity

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: "review";
  data: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    author: string;
    branch: string;
    baseBranch: string;
    status: ReviewStatus;
    priority: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical";
    assignedReviewers: string[];
    approvedBy: string[];
    changesRequestedBy: string[];
    labels: string[];
    filesChanged: number;
    linesAdded: number;
    linesDeleted: number;
    createdAt: number;
  };
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

### Comment Entity

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: "comment";
  data: {
    reviewId: string;
    author: string;
    content: string;
    filePath?: string;        // For inline comments
    lineNumber?: number;      // For inline comments
    lineType?: "addition" | "deletion" | "context";
    isResolved: boolean;
    isCode: boolean;          // Code suggestion
    parentCommentId?: string; // For threading
    createdAt: number;
  };
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

### File Entity

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: "file";
  data: {
    reviewId: string;
    path: string;
    status: "added" | "modified" | "deleted" | "renamed";
    linesAdded: number;
    linesDeleted: number;
    oldPath?: string;         // For renamed files
    isBinary: boolean;
    language?: string;
    hasConflicts: boolean;
  };
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

## Kalphite Integration Highlights

### Memory-First Architecture

```typescript
// Direct array access with reactive updates
const reviews = reviewStore.review.filter((r) => r.data.status === "open");
const urgentReviews = reviews.filter((r) => r.data.priority === "high");
```

### Type-Safe Operations

```typescript
// Full TypeScript support with discriminated unions
const review = createReview(title, description, author, branch, {
  status: "open",
  priority: "high",
  assignedReviewers: ["alice", "bob"],
});
```

### Reactive Subscriptions

```typescript
// Real-time updates when data changes
reviewStore.subscribe(() => {
  console.log("Review data updated!");
  updateUI();
});
```

### Cross-Entity Relationships

```typescript
// Efficient querying across related entities
const reviewFiles = files.filter((f) => f.data.reviewId === review.id);
const reviewComments = comments.filter((c) => c.data.reviewId === review.id);
```

## Performance Characteristics

The Core Review Tool demonstrates Kalphite's performance advantages:

- **Instant Queries** - All data in memory, no database round trips
- **Reactive Updates** - UI updates automatically when data changes
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support prevents runtime errors
- **Memory Efficiency** - Optimized data structures and garbage collection

### Benchmark Results

```
‚úÖ Created 1000 reviews in 45.23ms
üìä Total entities: 5000
‚ö° Average: 0.045ms per review
üîç Found 250 urgent reviews in 2.1ms
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Simplified State Management**

No complex state management libraries needed - Kalphite handles reactivity and updates automatically.

### 2. **Real-time Collaboration**
