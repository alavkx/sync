# Kalphite Core Review Demo - Project Status

_Last Updated: January 2024_

## 🎯 **Current State**

The Kalphite Core Review demo app is **partially functional** with local persistence working but **network sync still incomplete**. The app demonstrates Kalphite's memory-first architecture with automatic localStorage persistence, but real-time collaboration features are not yet active.

### ✅ **What's Working**

- **Memory-first store** - Fast, synchronous operations
- **Local persistence** - Data auto-saves to localStorage with 1s debounce
- **Data management** - Export/import functionality via UI controls
- **React integration** - Reactive updates using Kalphite hooks
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support with runtime validation
- **UI responsiveness** - No blocking operations, smooth interactions

### ❌ **Critical Issue: Network Sync Not Active**

**Problem**: When you create or modify code reviews, **no network requests are sent**. The sync engine infrastructure exists but is not properly integrated with the store operations.

**Current Behavior**:

```
1. User creates a review → ✅ Store updated locally
2. User creates a review → ✅ Data saved to localStorage
3. User creates a review → ❌ NO network request sent
4. Multiple clients → ❌ NO synchronization occurs
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Current Architecture**

```
React UI ──────► KalphiteStore ──────► MemoryFlushEngine ──────► localStorage
                      │                                              │
                      │                                              ▼
                      └──────────────────────────────────► (Network: Not Connected)
```

### **Target Architecture**

```
React UI ──────► KalphiteStore ──────► MemoryFlushEngine ──────► localStorage
                      │                         │                    │
                      │                         ▼                    ▼
                      └──────► OperationSyncEngine ──────► Network Server
                                         │
                                         ▼
                              WebSocket Real-time Updates
```

### **Missing Integration Points**

1. **Store → Sync Engine Connection**

   - Store operations don't trigger sync engine calls
   - Need to wire `reviewStore.review.push()` → `syncEngine.executeOperation()`

2. **Operation Mapping**

   - Raw entity mutations need to map to named operations
   - `createReview()`, `updateReview()`, `addComment()` operations needed

3. **Server Infrastructure**
   - No backend server running on `localhost:3001`
   - Need sync endpoints: `/api/operations`, `/api/state`

## 🚀 **Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **Phase 1: Fix Network Sync Integration** ⏰ _URGENT_

```typescript
// Need to implement this flow:
reviewStore.review.push(newReview)
  → syncEngine.executeOperation("createReview", [reviewData])
  → POST localhost:3001/api/operations
  → Other clients receive update
```

**Tasks**:

1. **Wire store operations to sync engine calls**
2. **Create operation mapping layer** (entity mutations → named operations)
3. **Add sync engine initialization** to store configuration
4. **Test network request generation**

### **Phase 2: Backend Server Implementation**

**Tasks**:

1. **Create minimal Node.js sync server**
2. **Implement `/api/operations` and `/api/state` endpoints**
3. **Add WebSocket support for real-time updates**
4. **Test multi-client synchronization**

### **Phase 3: Production Readiness**

**Tasks**:

1. **Error recovery and retry logic**
2. **Offline queue management**
3. **Conflict resolution UI**
4. **Performance optimization**

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

### **MVP Definition** (Phase 1 Complete)

- [ ] Creating a review sends network request
- [ ] Browser dev tools show POST to `/api/operations`
- [ ] Console logs network sync attempts
- [ ] Multiple browser tabs can simulate multi-client sync

### **Full Demo** (Phase 2 Complete)

- [ ] Real-time collaboration between browser tabs
- [ ] Changes in one client appear in another instantly
- [ ] Offline/online transitions work seamlessly
- [ ] Data consistency maintained across clients

## 🔍 **Current Investigation Needed**

### **Why Network Requests Aren't Happening**

1. **Store Integration**: The `MemoryFlushEngine` is configured but `OperationSyncEngine` is not
2. **Operation Mapping**: Store mutations (push/splice/etc.) don't map to sync operations
3. **Hook Integration**: React hooks don't trigger network sync calls

### **Code Locations to Check**

- `packages/kalphite/examples/core-review/store.ts` - Missing sync engine integration
- `packages/kalphite/examples/core-review/react-app/src/lib/hooks.ts` - May need sync triggers
- `packages/kalphite/src/store/KalphiteStore.ts` - Operation sync integration points

## 📋 **Testing Strategy**

### **Manual Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Load demo data → Check browser network tab
- [ ] Create new review → Verify POST request sent
- [ ] Open multiple tabs → Confirm sync behavior
- [ ] Go offline → Test queue/retry logic
- [ ] Refresh page → Verify persistence

### **Automated Testing**

- [ ] Unit tests for sync engine integration
- [ ] Multi-client integration tests
- [ ] Network failure simulation tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## 🎨 **Demo Scenarios**

### **Current Demo** (Persistence Only)

1. Load demo data → Data persists across refreshes ✅
2. Export/clear data → UI controls work ✅
3. Fast operations → No UI blocking ✅

### **Target Demo** (Full Sync)

1. **Multi-client collaboration** → Changes sync between tabs
2. **Real-time updates** → See live review status changes
3. **Offline resilience** → Queue operations, sync when online
4. **Conflict resolution** → Handle concurrent edits gracefully

## 💡 **Key Insights**

The **memory-first architecture is working perfectly** - operations are fast, UI is responsive, and local persistence is reliable. The missing piece is the **"network bridge"** that connects local operations to distributed sync.

Once this bridge is complete, Kalphite will demonstrate its core value proposition: **making distributed systems feel like local operations** while maintaining data consistency across clients.

The foundation is solid; we just need to complete the connection layer.
