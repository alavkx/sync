# Understanding Sync Engines Through Building a Code Review Tool

A comprehensive guide to understanding sync engines by implementing a real-world code review application.

## Teaching Strategy

We'll learn sync engine concepts by building a **Code Review Tool** that naturally requires synchronization:

- **Comments** must sync across reviewers in real-time
- **Review status** updates need immediate propagation
- **Diff viewing** should be consistent across users
- **Collaborative editing** of review feedback
- **Offline support** for reviewing code without connectivity

This practical approach demonstrates sync engine concepts through concrete, relatable examples rather than abstract theory.

## Module 1: Core Concepts & Architecture

1. **The Big Picture**

   - Understanding sync in code review context
   - Why code reviews need sync engines
   - Multi-user collaboration challenges
   - Real-time vs. eventual consistency trade-offs

2. **Code Review Sync Architecture**
   - Comment synchronization patterns
   - Review state management
   - Diff consistency across clients
   - User presence and activity tracking

## Module 2: Comment Synchronization System

1. **Comment Operations & Changes**

   - Adding inline comments to code lines
   - Editing and deleting comments
   - Comment threading and replies
   - Optimistic UI updates

2. **Real-time Comment Sync**
   - Push: Local comments to server
   - Pull: Remote comments from server
   - Conflict resolution for comment edits
   - Comment ordering and versioning

## Module 3: Review State Management

1. **Review Status Synchronization**

   - Approval/rejection state changes
   - Review completion tracking
   - Status conflict resolution
   - Atomic review submissions

2. **Performance & Optimization**
   - Batching comment operations
   - Selective diff loading
   - Comment caching strategies
   - Network-aware sync timing

## Module 4: Advanced Sync Patterns

1. **Collaborative Features**

   - Multiple reviewers on same diff
   - Real-time cursor/selection sharing
   - Comment collision detection
   - User presence indicators

2. **Offline & Reliability**
   - Offline comment composition
   - Sync resume after connectivity loss
   - Conflict resolution UI
   - Data integrity guarantees

## Module 5: Production Implementation

1. **Code Review Tool Architecture**

   - Git integration for diffs
   - Database schema for comments/reviews
   - API design for sync operations
   - Frontend state management

2. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Sync engine testing strategies
   - Multi-user scenario testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error recovery patterns
