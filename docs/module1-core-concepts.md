# Module 1: Core Concepts & Architecture

## 1. The Big Picture

### Understanding Sync in Code Review Context

Code review tools present unique synchronization challenges that make them perfect for learning sync engine concepts:

1. **Multi-User Collaboration**

   - Multiple developers reviewing the same code
   - Real-time comment discussions
   - Concurrent approval/rejection decisions
   - Shared viewing of diffs and file changes

2. **Comment Synchronization**

   - Inline comments on specific lines
   - Comment threads and replies
   - Edit/delete operations on existing comments
   - Real-time visibility of new comments

3. **Review State Management**
   - Approval status changes
   - Review completion tracking
   - Status conflicts (multiple reviewers)
   - Atomic review submissions

### Why Code Reviews Need Sync Engines

Traditional code review tools face several synchronization problems:

1. **Stale State Problems**

   - Reviewer A adds a comment, but Reviewer B doesn't see it
   - Review status appears "pending" when it's actually "approved"
   - Outdated diff views showing old code

2. **Collaboration Friction**

   - Comments lost during page refreshes
   - No real-time feedback during review sessions
   - Conflicting review decisions

3. **Offline/Connectivity Issues**
   - Comments composed offline aren't saved
   - Network failures lose review progress
   - Mobile reviewing without reliable connectivity

### Code Review Sync Engine Architecture

Our sync engine will solve these problems with three core components:

1. **Client-Side Comment Store**

   - Local comment cache for instant responses
   - Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
   - Offline comment composition and storage
   - Background sync with conflict resolution

2. **Server-Side Review State**

   - Centralized comment storage and versioning
   - Review status coordination across clients
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
   - Push/pull endpoints for synchronization

3. **Real-time Sync Protocol**
   - Comment push: Client → Server new/edited comments
   - Comment pull: Server → Client remote comments
   - Status updates: Real-time review state changes
   - Presence: Show active reviewers and their focus

### Key Components: Comments, Reviews, and Sync Protocol

#### Comment System Components

- **Comment Store**: Local cache of all comments with metadata
- **Comment Editor**: UI for creating/editing inline comments
- **Comment Renderer**: Display comments with proper threading
- **Sync Manager**: Handles comment synchronization logic

#### Review State Components

- **Review Status**: Current approval/rejection state
- **Reviewer Presence**: Track active reviewers and their locations
- **Diff Viewer**: Consistent code diff rendering across clients
- **Review Actions**: Approve, reject, submit operations

#### Sync Protocol Components

- **Push Operations**: Send local changes to server
  - New comments
  - Comment edits/deletes
  - Review status changes
- **Pull Operations**: Receive remote changes from server

  - Comments from other reviewers
  - Review status updates
  - Diff updates (if code changes)

- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent modifications
  - Comment edit conflicts
  - Review status conflicts
  - Optimistic update rollbacks

## Practical Example: Comment Synchronization Flow

Let's trace through a real code review scenario:

1. **Developer A** opens a pull request for review
2. **Reviewer B** adds an inline comment: "This could be optimized"
3. **Reviewer C** simultaneously adds a comment on the same line
4. Our sync engine handles this by:
   - Locally storing B's comment immediately (optimistic UI)
   - Pushing B's comment to server in background
   - Pulling C's comment when it arrives
   - Resolving any display conflicts (both comments shown)
   - Maintaining consistent comment ordering across all clients

## Next Steps

In the next module, we'll implement our first sync component: the **Comment Synchronization System**. We'll build:

- Comment data structures and storage
- Optimistic comment UI updates
- Push/pull synchronization for comments
- Basic conflict resolution
