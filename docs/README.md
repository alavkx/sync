# Kalphite Sync Engine Documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation

- **[memory-first-sync-master.md](./memory-first-sync-master.md)** - Complete architecture guide with schema strategy and implementation patterns
- **[prd.md](./prd.md)** - Original code review app requirements

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Start**

1. **Read**: [memory-first-sync-master.md](./memory-first-sync-master.md) for complete architecture
2. **Understand**: The schema-agnostic approach with Standard Schema integration
3. **Implement**: Follow the implementation guide with your preferred schema library

## ðŸš€ **Key Features**

### Schema-Agnostic Design

- **Standard Schema Integration**: Use any compliant schema library (Zod, Valibot, ArkType, etc.)
- **Type Safety Everywhere**: Full TypeScript inference from user's schema
- **Zero Lock-in**: Kalphite doesn't dictate validation approach

### Memory-First Approach

- All data lives in memory for synchronous access
- Background persistence with automatic flushing
- Single `useKalphiteStore()` hook for all React components

### Radical Simplification

- Every component re-renders on every change (intentionally!)
- No complex selectors or optimizations
- Direct data access like a local JavaScript object

### 4-Layer Architecture

1. **Hot**: In-Memory Store (RAM) with schema validation
2. **Warm**: Memory Flush Engine (Memory â†’ Disk)
3. **Cool**: Frontend Database (PGlite + IndexedDB)
4. **Cold**: Network Sync Engine (Server communication)

## ðŸ“ˆ **Philosophy**

Kalphite represents a radical simplification of traditional sync engines by embracing trade-offs (performance for simplicity) to create dramatically better developer experience. The result is a sync engine that's **simple, predictable, type-safe, and impossible to get wrong** - perfect for learning, prototyping, and building real applications where "fast enough" is good enough.

## ðŸ”„ **Future Enhancements**

The master document contains everything needed to implement Kalphite with your preferred schema library. Future work could explore:

- Performance optimizations (when needed)
- Real-time WebSocket integration
- Advanced conflict resolution strategies
- Mobile/offline-first enhancements
